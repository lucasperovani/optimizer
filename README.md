# Optimizer
Optimizer for temperature compensation in transconductors.

This program is intended to be used as a way to calculate a voltage or current curve to correct the transconductance of differential pairs due to variations in temperature. Because it's a generic program, it can be used to other purposes.
The idea behind this program is to recreate any curve based only in line segments, where the segment starts at (Mb/Ma)*IB with inclination Md/Mc.
